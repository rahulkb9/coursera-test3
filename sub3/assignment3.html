Although traditionally cooked in a clay oven, you can prepare the yogurt-marinated chicken in a regular oven (or on the grill). You do need to plan ahead, as the coated chicken should sit in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. If you prefer, you can sear the marinated chicken cubes first on the stovetop to achieve that signature tandoori char.<br>It's hard to find anyone who doesn't fall in love with tandoori chicken, that famous Indian barbecue chicken recipe.

Mutter (meaning peas) paneer (a semi-solid form of cottage cheese) is probably the most frequently ordered vegetarian dish in Indian restaurants. The mild flavors of the paneer (cottage cheese) and peas in it, marry beautifully with the delicious tomato-based sauce of this curry! Mutter paneer is great side dish in a non-vegetarian meal but also the perfect main dish in a vegetarian one. Serve it with chapati, paratha, or naan or even on a bed of plain boiled basmati rice. Basically make and serve it in your home and you've got a sure crowd pleaser!<br>
